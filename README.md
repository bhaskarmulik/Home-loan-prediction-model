# Home Loan Approval Project

## Objective :
* The aim of this project is to determine, given a set of parameters, whether a canditate is suitable to recieve a home loan on a given property.
* For this project, the dataset is provided by Kaggle. The link for the same is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazid28/home-loan.
* Thus, for this project, we consider the 'Target' to be predicted as the 'Loan Status' feature, that indicates whether a given canditate is dispensed the loan.
* The flow of the project is as follows : 
    * Perform exploratory data analysis on the data. This includes : 
        * Inspection of the data
        * Performing univariate and bivariate analysis
        * Visualizing the relationships between features
    * Data cleaning and preparation
        * Cleaning the data of any anomalies
        * Preparing the data for further steps
    * Using Feature Engineering to :
        * Analyse and choose informative features
        * Creating new features that might have stronger relationship
        * Preparing the data for the ML model
    * Using Machine Learning to : 
        * Determine the most optimal model for the task
        * Use the said model to predict the outcome.
